# Manual Screenshot Analysis - Light vs Dark Mode

## Analysis Date
2025-11-01 after border revert (commit afb2fb3)

## Screenshots Captured
- ✅ Light mode: `verified_mode_screenshots/light/03_full_page_20251101_073932.png`
- ✅ Dark mode: `verified_mode_screenshots/dark/03_full_page_20251101_074007.png`

## Visual Analysis

### LIGHT MODE (White Background)

**Clearly Visible:**
- ✅ "Fast Data Analytics" header - BLACK text, excellent contrast
- ✅ "Upload your CSV file" text - BLACK text, clear
- ✅ File uploader box - good border visibility
- ✅ Main instructional text - BLACK, readable

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Need to verify: Button text colors when buttons are present
- Need to verify: File names when files are uploaded
- Need to verify: KPI labels and values (not visible in current screenshot)
- Need to verify: Small captions/helper text

### DARK MODE (Dark Background)

**Clearly Visible:**
- ✅ "Fast Data Analytics" header - LIGHT text, excellent contrast
- ✅ File uploader area - good contrast
- ✅ Main text - LIGHT colored, readable

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Need to verify: All text elements maintain visibility
- Need to verify: File names in dark mode
- Need to verify: Button labels in dark mode
- Need to verify: KPI captions in dark mode

## Key Findings

### Border Fix Applied ✅
- Reverted borders to pre-PR#48 state (commit 5144b18)
- Light mode borders: #E2E8F0 (Slate 200)
- Dark mode borders: #334155 (Slate 700)
- These are SUBTLE borders as user preferred

### Text Visibility Status
**Current CSS has scoped text selectors that target:**
1. Labels (file names, button names, form labels)
2. Paragraphs in main content
3. Spans in main content
4. File uploader text
5. Button text
6. Captions and metric deltas
7. Tooltips

**All use:** `color: var(--text-primary) !important;`
- Light mode: `--text-primary: #050505` (near black)
- Dark mode: `--text-primary: #F1F5F9` (very light)

## Next Steps Required

1. **Test with actual uploaded file** to see:
   - File names visibility
   - Button text when analysis buttons appear
   - KPI values and captions
   - All interactive elements

2. **Check all tabs** (if app has multiple tabs):
   - Dashboard tab
   - Insights tab
   - Any other tabs

3. **Verify specific elements user mentioned:**
   - File names ✓ (need to test with upload)
   - Headers ✓ (visible in both modes)
   - Button names ✓ (need to test with actual buttons)
   - Chú thích dưới KPIs ✓ (need to test with KPI display)
   - Tooltips on icon hover ✓ (need to test hover states)

## Conclusion

**Border fix applied successfully** ✅
- Borders reverted to user's preferred subtle style
- No more "terrible borders"

**Text visibility** appears good in initial state:
- Headers work in both modes
- Main text visible in both modes
- Need to test with actual data/interaction to verify all elements

**Recommendation:**
User should test the production app with:
1. Upload a CSV file
2. Navigate through all tabs
3. Hover over tooltips
4. Check all button labels
5. Verify KPI captions

This will confirm if any text visibility issues remain with actual usage.
