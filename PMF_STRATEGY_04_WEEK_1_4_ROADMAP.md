---

## ‚úÖ END OF WEEK 4: DECISION POINT

### Scenario A: SUCCESS (10+ Paying Customers) ‚úÖ
```
Congratulations! You have PMF signal.

Next 30 days:
1. Double down on what's working (LinkedIn? Product-led?)
2. Hire part-time VA for support (‚Ç´3-4M/month)
3. Scale content (2 ‚Üí 3 posts/week)
4. Expand to more domains (focus on adjacent)
5. Target: 30 customers by Day 60

Read: REVISED_BUSINESS_MODEL_CANVAS.md (Month 2-3 plan)
```

### Scenario B: PARTIAL (3-9 Customers) ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
You have early traction but need iteration.

Diagnose:
- Activation problem? (users confused)
- Pricing problem? (too expensive)
- Value problem? (not solving real pain)
- Competition problem? (better alternatives)

Next 30 days:
1. Do 5 more customer interviews
2. Adjust based on feedback
3. Test new pricing (‚Ç´49K ‚Üí ‚Ç´79K?)
4. Improve core feature
5. Target: 10+ customers by Day 60
```

### Scenario C: FAILURE (0-2 Customers) üõë
```
Honest assessment needed.

Hard truths:
- Maybe problem not painful enough
- Maybe solution not good enough
- Maybe target market wrong
- Maybe you need co-founder

Decision:
1. PIVOT: Different target market (B2B ‚Üí B2C?)
2. PIVOT: Different product (dashboard ‚Üí something else?)
3. PAUSE: Go back to day job, rethink
4. PERSIST: Give 30 more days with major changes

Talk to mentor/advisor before deciding.
Don't waste 6 more months on wrong idea.
