4. **CRITICAL**: Wait for ALL sections to render before validation

---

### Step 2: Validate Core KPIs (8 metrics) ‚úÖ

**Expected KPIs** (from manual calculation):

| KPI | Expected Value | Tolerance | Status Check |
|-----|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Avg First Response Time** | 18.81 min | ¬±0.5 min | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL |

---

### Step 3: Validate Channel Breakdown ‚úÖ

**Expected Channel Performance**:

| Channel | Tickets | Avg FRT | Avg Res | CSAT | Expected Rank |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------------|
| **Live Chat** | 36 | 8.75 min | 0.59 hrs | **5.0** | ü•á #1 (Best) |
| **Phone** | 28 | 13.29 min | 3.20 hrs | 3.71 | #2 (Middle) |
| **Email** | 36 | 33.17 min | 9.02 hrs | 3.83 | ü•â #3 (Worst) |

**Critical Validations**:
- [ ] Live Chat has PERFECT 5.0 CSAT (only channel at 5.0)
- [ ] Email has SLOWEST response time (>30 min)
- [ ] Email has LONGEST resolution time (>8 hrs)
- [ ] Dashboard clearly shows Live Chat as winner

**Expected Insight**:
> "Live Chat delivers PERFECT 5.0 CSAT with fastest resolution (35 min). Email is your BOTTLENECK (9 hrs, 3.83 CSAT). **ACTION**: Shift 50% of Email tickets ‚Üí Live Chat to save 8 hrs per ticket and improve CSAT from 3.83 ‚Üí 5.0."

---

### Step 4: Validate Agent Performance ‚úÖ

**Expected Agent Rankings**:

| Rank | Agent | Tickets | CSAT | FRT | Resolution |
|------|-------|---------|------|-----|------------|
| ü•á | Nguyen Van A | 21 | 4.29 | 17.19 min | 3.70 hrs |
| ü•á | Tran Thi B | 21 | 4.29 | 16.90 min | 3.43 hrs |
| ü•â | Le Van C | 20 | 4.20 | 19.25 min | 4.87 hrs |
| #4 | Hoang Van E | 19 | 4.16 | 19.89 min | 4.49 hrs |
| #5 | Pham Thi D | 19 | 4.16 | 21.16 min | 5.43 hrs |

**Critical Validations**:
- [ ] Nguyen Van A & Tran Thi B tied at top (both 4.29 CSAT)
- [ ] Pham Thi D at bottom (slowest response + longest resolution)
- [ ] Clear performance gap between top (4.29) and bottom (4.16)

**Expected Insight**:
> "**TOP PERFORMERS**: Nguyen Van A & Tran Thi B (4.29 CSAT, <17 min FRT) - Document their best practices. **NEEDS COACHING**: Pham Thi D (slowest in team, 21 min FRT, 5.43 hrs resolution) - Train on top performer techniques."

---

### Step 5: Validate Priority Analysis ‚úÖ

**Expected Priority Performance**:

| Priority | Tickets | Avg FRT | Avg Res | SLA Met |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **High** | 36 | 21.89 min | 6.74 hrs | **55.56%** ‚ùå |
| **Medium** | 29 | 20.90 min | 5.85 hrs | 75.86% |
| **Low** | 35 | 13.91 min | 0.65 hrs | **100%** ‚úÖ |

**CRITICAL PROBLEM**:
- [ ] High Priority SLA = 55.56% (BELOW 85% target)
- [ ] High Priority takes LONGEST (6.74 hrs vs 0.65 hrs for Low)
- [ ] Low Priority has PERFECT 100% SLA

**Expected Insight**:
> "‚ùå **CRITICAL**: High Priority tickets only meet SLA 55.56% of time (target: 85%+). You're failing your most important customers! Average 6.74 hrs resolution vs target <4 hrs. **ACTION**: Implement High Priority fast-track queue with <15 min FRT target."

---

### Step 6: Validate Category Breakdown ‚úÖ

**Expected Critical Problem Categories**:

| Category | Tickets | Escalation | CSAT | Status |
|----------|---------|------------|------|--------|
| **Account Access** | 14 | **50.0%** | **2.71** | ‚ùå WORST |
| **Product Defect** | 14 | **100%** | 3.43 | ‚ùå CRITICAL |
| Billing Question | 15 | 0% | **5.00** | ‚≠ê PERFECT |
| How-to Question | 14 | 0% | **5.00** | ‚≠ê PERFECT |
| Technical Issue | 15 | 0% | 4.33 | ‚úÖ Good |
| Feature Request | 14 | 0% | 4.50 | ‚úÖ Good |
| Shipping Delay | 14 | 0% | 4.50 | ‚úÖ Good |

**CRITICAL VALIDATIONS**:
- [ ] Account Access has WORST CSAT (2.71 - far below all others)
- [ ] Account Access has 50% escalation (7 out of 14 tickets)
- [ ] Product Defect has 100% escalation (ALL tickets escalated!)
- [ ] Billing & How-to have PERFECT 5.0 CSAT

**Expected Insights**:
1. **Account Access Crisis**:
> "‚ùå Account Access = your BIGGEST problem (2.71 CSAT, 50% escalation, high reopen rate). 14 tickets/month but massive customer frustration. **ACTION**: Build self-service password reset to eliminate 80% of these tickets (save 216 hrs/month = 130M VND/year)."

2. **Product Defect Bottleneck**:
> "‚ùå Product Defect = 100% escalation (ALL 14 tickets go to engineering). This overwhelms your technical team and delays resolution (5.67 hrs avg). **ACTION**: Better QA to prevent defects + faster triage process."

3. **Success Pattern**:
> "‚≠ê Billing & How-to = PERFECT 5.0 CSAT with 0% escalation. Document these best practices and apply to other categories."

---

### Step 7: Validate Customer Segment Analysis ‚úÖ

**Expected Segment Performance**:

| Segment | Tickets | Total Value (VND) | CSAT | SLA Met |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------|---------|
| **Premium** | 36 (36%) | 255,400,000 (64%) | **3.64** ‚ö†Ô∏è | **55.56%** ‚ùå |
| **Standard** | 64 (64%) | 142,445,000 (36%) | **4.55** ‚úÖ | **89.06%** ‚úÖ |

**üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT - Premium Paradox**:
- [ ] Premium customers have LOWER CSAT (3.64 vs 4.55) - 0.91 point gap
- [ ] Premium customers have WORSE SLA (55.56% vs 89.06%) - 33.5% gap
- [ ] Premium customers = 64% of revenue (255M VND) but unhappy
- [ ] Standard customers = better service despite paying less

**Expected Critical Insight**:
> "üö® **PREMIUM PARADOX ALERT**: Your Premium customers (64% of revenue = 255M VND) are getting WORSE service than Standard customers (3.64 vs 4.55 CSAT, 55% vs 89% SLA). They pay MORE but get LESS. This is backwards and DANGEROUS!"
>
> "**CHURN RISK**: 36 Premium customers √ó 30% churn √ó 7.1M LTV = **76.5M VND lost/year**. If all churn, **7.65 BILLION VND** lifetime value at risk."
>
> "**ACTION REQUIRED**: Implement Premium Support Tier with <10 min FRT, dedicated agents, priority queue. Cost: 5M VND/month. Retention improvement: +30%. **ROI**: 382M VND saved over 5 years."

---

### Step 8: Validate Business Opportunity Calculation ‚úÖ

**Expected Opportunities** (total 603M VND/year):

1. **Premium Customer Recovery**: 382M VND (5-year)
   - [ ] Improve Premium CSAT from 3.64 ‚Üí 4.5
   - [ ] Reduce churn from 30% ‚Üí 10%
   - [ ] Retention value: 76.5M √ó 5 years

2. **Email ‚Üí Live Chat Shift**: 91M VND/year
   - [ ] Move 50% of Email tickets to Live Chat
   - [ ] Save 8 hrs per ticket √ó 18 tickets = 151.7 agent hrs/month
   - [ ] Cost savings: 7.6M VND/month

3. **Self-Service Password Reset**: 130M VND/year
   - [ ] Eliminate 80% of Account Access tickets (11 tickets/month)
   - [ ] Save 216 agent hrs/month
   - [ ] Cost savings: 10.8M VND/month

**Expected Final Recommendation**:
> "**TOTAL OPPORTUNITY**: 603M VND/year + 382M long-term retention = **985M VND** total value."
>
> "**PRIORITY ACTIONS**:  
> 1. URGENT: Fix Premium support (7.65B VND at risk)  
> 2. HIGH: Build password reset (130M/year savings)  
> 3. MEDIUM: Shift Email ‚Üí Live Chat (91M/year savings)"
>
> "**ROI**: ‚àû (infinite) - FREE tool, 985M VND value  
> **Payback**: Immediate (no cost)"
