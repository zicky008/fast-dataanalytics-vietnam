## 🎯 Interview Script (15 Minutes Total)

### **INTRO (2 minutes)**

#### Opening (Vietnamese):
```
"Chào [Anh/Chị Name],

Cảm ơn [Anh/Chị] đã dành thời gian!

Tôi đang research về pain points của CEO/Manager Việt Nam
trong việc analyze data và tạo báo cáo.

Mục đích: Học hỏi từ experience của [Anh/Chị],
KHÔNG phải sales call.

[Anh/Chị] OK nếu tôi record lại để review sau không?
(Chỉ cho internal research, không share ra ngoài)"
```

#### If they say YES to recording:
✅ Start recording

#### If they say NO:
✅ Take detailed notes manually

---

### **SECTION 1: Current Process (4 minutes)**

#### Q1: Data Analysis Current State
```vietnamese
"Hiện tại, [Anh/Chị] làm báo cáo/analyze data như thế nào?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- Tool they use (Excel, Google Sheets, BI tools?)
- Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly?)
- Time spent (hours per week?)
- Pain points (manual, slow, error-prone?)

💡 Follow-up questions:
- "Mất bao lâu để tạo 1 báo cáo?"
- "Có gặp khó khăn gì không?"
- "Có phải làm manual hay tự động?"
```

#### Q2: Pain Severity (Rate 1-10)
```vietnamese
"Nếu rate pain point này từ 1-10
(1 = không đau, 10 = rất đau), [Anh/Chị] cho bao nhiêu điểm?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- 8-10 = Strong pain (GREAT!)
- 5-7 = Moderate pain (OK, but need to make value clear)
- 1-4 = Low pain (Problem may not be worth solving)

💡 Why this matters:
- Only solve problems rated 8+ by 80%+ of interviewees
- If avg < 7, may need to pivot target market or problem
```

#### Q3: Cost of Current Solution
```vietnamese
"Hiện tại [Anh/Chị] spend bao nhiêu (time + money) cho việc này?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- Time: "5 hours/week" → Value = ₫2M+/month (if ₫100K/hour)
- Money: "₫500K/month for tool X"
- People: "1 person full-time" → ₫10M+/month

💡 Calculation:
- If they spend ₫1M+/month now
- Your tool at ₫99K = 90% savings
- Easy sell!
```

---

### **SECTION 2: Willingness to Pay (3 minutes)**

#### Q4: Value Perception
```vietnamese
"Nếu có tool tự động analyze data + tạo dashboard trong 60 giây,
[Anh/Chị] nghĩ nó valuable như thế nào?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- Immediate excitement? ("Wow! Tôi cần ngay!")
- Skepticism? ("Nghe hay nhưng liệu có work không?")
- Indifference? ("Có thì cũng OK...")

💡 Body language (if video):
- Leaning forward = Interested
- Leaning back = Not convinced
- Nodding = Engaged
```

#### Q5: Pricing Validation (Critical!)
```vietnamese
"Nếu tool này cost ₫99K/tháng (giá 2 ly cà phê/tuần),
[Anh/Chị] sẽ:
A) Chắc chắn dùng
B) Có thể cân nhắc
C) Quá đắt, không dùng"

🎯 What to listen for:
- A) YES! → 5/5 say this = Strong PMF signal
- B) Maybe → Need to understand objection
- C) NO → Ask: "Giá bao nhiêu thì OK?"

💡 Pricing benchmarks:
- If 4/5 say "A" at ₫99K → ✅ Good pricing
- If 4/5 say "B" → Test ₫79K or ₫49K
- If 4/5 say "C" → Either:
  - Price too high (lower to ₫49K)
  - Value not clear (improve demo)
  - Wrong target market (pivot)
```

#### Q6: Decision Process
```vietnamese
"Nếu [Anh/Chị] quyết định dùng tool này:
- Ai là người quyết định? ([Anh/Chị] hay boss?)
- Mất bao lâu để quyết định? (1 ngày, 1 tuần, 1 tháng?)
- Cần approval của ai?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- "Tôi quyết định" = Short sales cycle (1-7 days)
- "Phải hỏi boss" = Longer cycle (14-30 days)
- "Phải qua procurement" = Very long (30-90 days) → B2B hard

💡 Sales cycle by company size:
- Startup/SME (<20 people): 1-7 days
- Mid-size (20-100): 14-30 days
- Enterprise (>100): 30-90 days
```

---

### **SECTION 3: Feature Priorities (3 minutes)**

#### Q7: Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have
```vietnamese
"Nếu tool này có các tính năng sau, [Anh/Chị] rate priority:

A) Auto-generate dashboard (60 giây)
B) Vietnamese language UI
C) Expert insights (CMO/CFO recommendations)
D) Export PDF/PPT
E) Integrate với Shopify/Haravan
F) Real-time sync (update tự động hàng ngày)
G) Team collaboration (share với team)

Đâu là MUST-HAVE (không thể thiếu)?
Đâu là NICE-TO-HAVE (có thì tốt)?
Đâu là DON'T-CARE (không quan tâm)?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- 80% say "A, B, D" = Must-have → Build these first
- 50% say "E, F, G" = Nice-to-have → Build later
- 20% say anything = Don't care → Don't build

💡 Feature prioritization:
- Build only what 60%+ say "Must-have"
- Ignore what <30% want (not worth time)
```

#### Q8: Deal Breakers
```vietnamese
"Có điều gì làm [Anh/Chị] KHÔNG dùng tool này không?

Ví dụ:
- Quá phức tạp (cần training)
- Data security (sợ mất dữ liệu)
- Integration (không connect được với hệ thống hiện tại)
- Support (không có support tiếng Việt)
- Khác?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- Data security → Add: "100% data privacy, ISO compliance"
- Too complex → Simplify UX, add tutorial
- No integration → Prioritize Shopify/Haravan connectors
- No VN support → Zalo support (2h response)

💡 Common objections in Vietnam:
1. "Sợ mất data" → PDPD compliance, local storage
2. "Không biết dùng" → Tutorial video, Zalo support
3. "Quá đắt" → Show ROI (save 5h/week = ₫2M/month)
```

---

### **SECTION 4: Demo (2 minutes - Optional)**

#### Only if they're interested:
```vietnamese
"[Anh/Chị] có muốn xem demo nhanh (2 phút) không?"

🎯 If YES:
1. Share screen
2. Show: Upload CSV → Wait 60s → Dashboard appears
3. Highlight: 9 KPIs, 8 charts, 12 insights
4. Key message: "Đây là kết quả từ data của [Anh/Chị]"

🎯 If NO:
- Don't push!
- Offer: "Tôi gửi video 3 phút qua email nhé?"
```

---

### **CLOSING (1 minute)**

```vietnamese
"Cảm ơn [Anh/Chị] rất nhiều!

Cuối cùng, [Anh/Chị] có muốn:
A) Early access (free 30 days) khi launch?
B) Update progress khi có gì mới?
C) Không quan tâm nữa?

[Anh/Chị] chọn gì?"

🎯 What to listen for:
- A) → Add to "Hot Leads" list (email within 24h)
- B) → Add to "Warm Leads" (email weekly update)
- C) → Thank them, remove from list

💡 Follow-up:
- A) Hot Leads → Email: "Early access link + ₫49K lifetime offer"
- B) Warm Leads → LinkedIn post weekly updates
- C) No interest → Move on, don't waste time
```

## 📊 After 5 Interviews: Synthesis

### Calculate These Metrics:

```python
# Pain Severity
avg_pain = (interview1_score + ... + interview5_score) / 5
# Target: 8+ average

# Willingness to Pay at ₫99K
conversion = (num_said_yes / 5) * 100
# Target: 60%+ said "A) Chắc chắn dùng"

# Feature Priorities
must_have_features = [features mentioned by 3+ people]
# Build only these first

# Deal Breakers
common_objections = [objections mentioned by 2+ people]
# Address these before launch
```

### Decision Framework:

```
✅ PROCEED (Strong PMF Signal):
- Avg pain: 8+/10
- Pricing: 4/5 say "Yes" at ₫99K
- Features: Clear top 3 must-haves
- Objections: Addressable (security, support, etc.)

⚠️ ITERATE (Weak PMF Signal):
- Avg pain: 5-7/10
- Pricing: 2-3/5 say "Yes", rest "Maybe"
- Features: No clear consensus
- Objections: Hard to fix (needs major product changes)

🛑 PIVOT (No PMF):
- Avg pain: <5/10
- Pricing: 0-1/5 say "Yes"
- Features: Everyone wants different things
- Objections: Fundamental (wrong problem, wrong market)
```

## 🎯 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Pitch the product** → This is learning, not selling
2. **Ask leading questions** → "Wouldn't you love a fast tool?" (biased)
3. **Ignore skepticism** → If they doubt, dig deeper
4. **Talk too much** → 80% listen, 20% talk
5. **Skip "Why?" 3x** → Always ask why to get root cause

### ✅ DO:
1. **Listen actively** → Nod, take notes, engage
2. **Ask open-ended** → "Tell me about..." not "Do you...?"
3. **Embrace silence** → Wait 3 seconds after they answer
4. **Probe deeper** → "Why is that?", "Can you elaborate?"
5. **Thank genuinely** → They're giving you invaluable insights

## 📈 Expected Outcomes (Week 1)

**Best Case** (Strong PMF):
- 5/5 rate pain 8+/10
- 4/5 say "Yes" to ₫99K pricing

- Some feature agreement

- → ⚠️ **ITERATE**: Lower price to ₫79K or ₫49K, improve value prop

**Worst Case** (No PMF):
- <3/5 rate pain 6+/10
- 0-1/5 say "Yes" to ₫99K
- No feature consensus
