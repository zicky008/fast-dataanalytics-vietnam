- [ ] Color coding clear (green = good, red = alert)?

**Expected**:
- Primary metrics (Revenue, Conversion, AOV) should be prominent
- Typography should follow 36px/28px/20px scale
- Clear visual separation between primary and secondary info

- [ ] Default view shows 3 primary KPIs?
- [ ] "Xem thêm" or expand button present?
- [ ] Click button → 9 more KPIs appear?
- [ ] Information doesn't overwhelm on first view?

**Expected**:
- Initial dashboard should be scannable in 5-30 seconds
- Additional details available on demand
- No information overload on landing

#### 3. Mobile Responsiveness (📱 REQUIRES MANUAL TEST)
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools
- [ ] Switch to mobile viewport (375x667 - iPhone SE)
- [ ] KPIs stack vertically?
- [ ] Text readable without zooming?
- [ ] Charts display correctly?

**Expected**:
- Layout adapts to mobile screen
- No horizontal scrolling required
- Touch targets adequately sized

#### 4. Performance (📱 REQUIRES MANUAL TEST)
- [ ] Time from upload to first insight: ____ seconds
- [ ] Dashboard interactive within 5 seconds?
- [ ] Charts render smoothly?
- [ ] No lag when expanding/collapsing sections?

**Target**: <55 seconds total, <5s for dashboard interactions

#### 5. Data Quality (📱 REQUIRES MANUAL TEST)
- [ ] Upload e-commerce sample data
- [ ] Domain detected correctly as "E-commerce"?
- [ ] Revenue calculations match expected values?
- [ ] Charts show correct data ranges?
- [ ] No missing or null values in primary KPIs?

**Expected**:
- Accurate domain detection
- Correct metric calculations
- Professional chart visualizations

#### 6. Microsoft Clarity (⏳ REQUIRES 2-4 HOURS)
- [ ] Visit app URL
- [ ] Perform test actions (upload, analyze, view charts)
- [ ] Wait 2-4 hours for Clarity data processing
- [ ] Check Clarity dashboard for session recordings
- [ ] Verify heatmaps captured

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT DECISION

### ✅ GO/NO-GO Criteria

**READY TO DEPLOY IF**:
- [x] App launches without critical errors ✅
- [x] Sample data loads successfully ✅
- [x] HTTP 200 OK response ✅
- [ ] Manual tests 1-5 pass (requires browser testing)
- [ ] No data accuracy issues
- [ ] Performance within targets

**Current Status**: **⏳ READY FOR STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT**

App passes automated tests and is stable enough for production testing. Manual UX tests should be performed after Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## 📊 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes):
1. ✅ Push code to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. ⏳ Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
3. ⏳ Get permanent production URL
4. ⏳ Perform manual tests (checklist above)
5. ⏳ Verify Microsoft Clarity integration

### Short-term (Next 24 hours):
6. ⏳ Share URL with 3 test users (1 per domain)
7. ⏳ Schedule 30-minute interviews using USER_INTERVIEW_SCRIPT_VI.md
8. ⏳ Begin collecting feedback

### Medium-term (Day 2-4):
9. ⏳ Conduct 3 user interviews
10. ⏳ Analyze Clarity session recordings
11. ⏳ Calculate Domain_Score for each domain
12. ⏳ Make decision: Which domain to deep dive in Phase 2

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Non-Critical (Cosmetic):
- ⚠️ Theme color warnings in console (9 instances)
  - **Impact**: None (UI renders correctly)
  - **Fix**: Optional theme configuration cleanup
  - **Priority**: Low

### Validation Needed:
- ❓ Progressive Disclosure implementation (commit message says "integrated" but needs visual confirmation)
- ❓ Visual Hierarchy CSS (font sizes need browser verification)
- ❓ Microsoft Clarity project ID (script present, but ID not confirmed)

## 📝 TESTING NOTES

### What Worked Well:
- ✅ App startup very fast (<12s)
- ✅ No critical errors in console
- ✅ Sample data structure correct
- ✅ Automated deployment tests help catch issues early

### What Needs Improvement:
- ⚠️ More browser-based automated tests (Selenium/Playwright)
- ⚠️ Visual regression testing for UX patterns
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring for real user data

### Recommendations:
1. Add Playwright tests for critical user flows (upload → analyze → view insights)
2. Set up visual diff testing for UI changes
3. Monitor real user performance metrics via Clarity
4. Consider adding automated accessibility tests (WCAG compliance)
