# 🔄 SESSION HANDOVER PROTOCOL

**Purpose**: Comprehensive system để AI Assistant có thể nhanh chóng nắm rõ toàn bộ project context mỗi session mới  
**Philosophy**: "Chi tiết nhỏ chuẩn → Scale lên = Thành công bền vững"  
**Goal**: Zero context loss giữa sessions

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

### Vấn Đề:
```
❌ AI không nhớ giữa sessions
❌ Mất context về project history
❌ Có thể lặp lại mistakes cũ
❌ Không biết constraints và rules
```

### Giải Pháp:
```
✅ Structured documentation system
✅ Mandatory reading checklist
✅ Living knowledge base
✅ Version-controlled context
```

2. What are the 3 critical lessons learned?
   → [AI lists them]

3. What bugs were recently fixed?
   → [AI lists them]

4. What is current production status?
   → 5-star quality, ready for use

5. What are pending tasks?
   → [AI lists them]

6. What prevention rules must I follow?
   → [AI lists them]

If cannot answer → READ AGAIN!
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (ALWAYS APPLY)

### From LESSONS_LEARNED.md:

#### Rule #1: Debug Code
```bash
# Before EVERY commit:
cd /home/user/webapp && grep -rn "🐛\|DEBUG\|TODO\|FIXME" . --include="*.py"

# If found → Remove before commit
```

#### Rule #2: Production URLs
```bash
# Always use current production URL
✅ https://fast-nicedashboard.streamlit.app/

# Update docs when URL changes
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's|old-url|new-url|g' {} \;
```

#### Rule #3: Quality Standards
```
✅ Data accuracy: 100% - Zero tolerance
✅ User experience: 5-star
✅ No debug code visible to users
✅ Professional appearance
```

#### Rule #4: Git Workflow
```bash
# Always:
1. Read files before editing
2. Check for debug code
3. Test changes
4. Commit with clear message
5. Push to GitHub
```

#### Rule #5: User Feedback Priority
```
User feedback = Highest priority
- Listen carefully
- Fix immediately
- Document lesson
- Prevent recurrence
```
