## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:

1. **"NGHIÊM TÚC" Research Approach**
   - Cross-validating benchmarks with 2-3 sources built credibility
   - Honest admission of data gaps prevented over-promising
   - Live link verification ensured no dead references

2. **Path C (Hybrid) Strategy**
   - "Deploy → Test → Iterate" aligns with "UY TÍN = DATA THẬT" principle
   - Avoids wasting time building features nobody wants
   - Enables data-driven decisions about which domain to focus on

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Detailed guides reduce deployment friction
   - Manual test checklists ensure quality
   - Interview scripts enable consistent user feedback

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Catches issues early (module paths, import errors)
   - Provides confidence before manual testing
   - Reduces debugging time

### What to Improve:

1. **Authentication Complexity**
   - Sandbox git authentication limitations require manual push
   - Solution: Provide clear manual deployment instructions

2. **Progressive Disclosure Verification**
   - Commit message says "integrated" but needs browser confirmation
   - Solution: Add Playwright visual regression tests

3. **Browser-Based Testing**
   - More automated browser tests needed (upload → analyze → verify)
   - Solution: Expand test_deployment.py with Playwright tests

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Need real-world performance data, not just local tests
   - Solution: Microsoft Clarity + Streamlit analytics after deployment
