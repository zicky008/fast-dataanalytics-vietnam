- Min: 30M VND/month
- Median: 40M VND/month
- Max: 50M VND/month

```

Action: Industry-wide problem, optimize verification process
```

### Sales Manager - B2B SaaS
**Daily Struggle**: "Deal n√†y 3 th√°ng r·ªìi ch∆∞a close, s·∫øp h·ªèi sao ch·∫≠m th·∫ø."

```
HR Professional ‚Üí vietnam_hr_salary_benchmarks_2024.csv
Marketing Manager ‚Üí vietnam_marketing_benchmarks_2024.csv
E-commerce Owner ‚Üí vietnam_ecommerce_benchmarks_2024.csv
Sales Manager ‚Üí vietnam_sales_benchmarks_2024.csv
```

### Step 2: Filter to Your Context
```
Example: Marketing Manager, E-commerce, Facebook Ads

Filter by:
- metric: "Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)"
- channel: "Facebook Ads"
- industry: "E-commerce"

Result: CPA = 85,000 VND (median), 65k-110k VND range
```

### Step 3: Compare Your Performance
```
Your CPA: 92,000 VND

Benchmark Analysis:
- Median: 85,000 VND ‚Üí You're 8% above median (acceptable)
- Q3 (75th percentile): 110,000 VND ‚Üí You're below Q3 (good!)
- Conclusion: Performance is market-rate, slight optimization possible
```

### Step 4: Set Realistic Targets
```
Current: 92k VND CPA
Target: 80k VND CPA (between median and Q1)
Action Plan:
- Improve creative (video ads perform 3-5x better)
- Test micro-influencer partnerships (42% engagement rate)
- Optimize mobile UX (75% of traffic is mobile)
- Use vouchers strategically (82% redemption rate)
```

To Management:

"Our Facebook Ads CPA is 92k VND, which is 8% above industry median (85k VND)
but within the acceptable range (Q1-Q3: 65k-110k VND).

The higher CPA is partially due to market conditions:
- Mobile-first audience (75% traffic) converts 15-20% lower
- Fashion category has high cart abandonment (68% industry avg)
- COD preference (62% of orders) adds friction

Recommendation: Optimize for mobile conversion (+0.3% CR = -12k CPA)
Target CPA: 80k VND (-13% improvement, achievable in Q1 2025)"
```
