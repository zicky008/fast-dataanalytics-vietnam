# üö® CRITICAL BUG REPORT: FCR/SLA VALUES SWAPPED

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Severity**: HIGH - Data Accuracy Issue  
**Impact**: Misleads real users about actual performance  
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## üîç PROBLEM SUMMARY

Production dashboard displays Customer Service KPIs with **SWAPPED VALUES** for:
- **First Contact Resolution (FCR)**: Shows 77.0% (WRONG - should be 82.0%)
- **SLA Met**: Shows 82.0% (WRONG - should be 77.0%)

---

## üìä EVIDENCE

### Ground Truth (from raw data):
```
CSV file: customer_service_tickets_30days.csv (100 tickets)

FCR Calculation:
  - Tickets with reopened='No': 82
  - Total tickets: 100
  - FCR Rate: 82.00%

SLA Met Calculation:
  - Tickets with sla_met='Yes': 77
  - Total tickets: 100
  - SLA Rate: 77.00%
```

### Production Display (from user screenshot #2 & #3):
```
Dashboard shows:
  - First Contact Resolution (%): 77.0
  - SLA Met (%): 82.0
```

###Swap Confirmation:
```
‚úÖ Correct FCR (82%) == Production SLA (82%)
‚úÖ Correct SLA (77%) == Production FCR (77%)

VERDICT: VALUES ARE DEFINITELY SWAPPED!
```

## üî¨ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Step 1: Verified Calculation Logic ‚úÖ

Checked `src/premium_lean_pipeline.py` lines 1065-1093:

```python
# 4. First Contact Resolution (FCR)
if reopened_cols:
    reopen_col = reopened_cols[0]
    total_tickets = len(df)
    not_reopened = df[reopen_col].astype(str).str.lower().isin(['no', 'false', '0']).sum()
    fcr_rate = (not_reopened / total_tickets) * 100
    kpis['First Contact Resolution (%)'] = {
        'value': float(fcr_rate),  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: 82.0
        ...
    }

# 5. SLA Compliance
if sla_cols:
    sla_col = sla_cols[0]
    total_tickets = len(df)
    sla_met = df[sla_col].astype(str).str.lower().isin(['yes', 'true', '1']).sum()
    sla_rate = (sla_met / total_tickets) * 100
    kpis['SLA Met (%)'] = {
        'value': float(sla_rate),  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: 77.0
        ...
    }
```

**Result**: Calculation logic is CORRECT. Values are calculated accurately.

###Step 2: Tested Calculation Independently ‚úÖ

Created test script `test_fcr_sla_calculation.py` and confirmed:
- FCR calculated as 82.00% ‚úÖ
- SLA calculated as 77.00% ‚úÖ

**Result**: Calculations work correctly in isolation.

### Step 3: Hypothesis - Where is the Swap?

Since calculations are correct but display is wrong, the swap must occur in:

**Hypothesis A**: Dictionary key/value mismatch during creation
- **Likelihood**: LOW
- **Reason**: Code clearly assigns to correct dictionary keys

**Hypothesis B**: Display layer reordering or mislabeling
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- **Reason**: Streamlit displays KPIs in dict order, but labels might mismatch

**Hypothesis C**: Caching or state management issue
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- **Reason**: Streamlit session state or caching could mix up values

**Hypothesis D**: Hidden bug in Streamlit Cloud deployment
- **Likelihood**: HIGH
- **Reason**: Works in test but fails in production = environment difference

**Hypothesis E**: Python dictionary ordering issue (Python <3.7)
- **Likelihood**: LOW
- **Reason**: Modern Python maintains dict order

### Step 4: Most Likely Root Causes

Based on evidence:

1. **Streamlit Caching/State Issue** (HIGH probability)
   - Old values cached from previous runs
   - Session state mixing up KPI assignments
   - Need hard refresh or cache clear

2. **Display Logic Bug in Streamlit Cloud** (MEDIUM probability)
   - Production environment behaves differently than local
   - KPI rendering order mismatch between local and cloud

3. **Code Not Fully Deployed** (HIGH probability)  
   - Recent fix (commit 2dda987) added Customer Service section
   - Streamlit Cloud may still be running OLD code without CS section
   - Old code showed generic stats, not domain-specific KPIs
   - Cache or deployment lag causing outdated code to run

## üí° WHY THIS MATTERS (Business Impact)

### For Real CX Officer Users:

**Scenario with WRONG data**:
- Sees FCR = 77% ‚Üí Thinks "needs improvement"
- Sees SLA = 82% ‚Üí Thinks "close to target (85%)"
- **Makes WRONG decisions based on inverted reality!**

**Scenario with CORRECT data**:
- FCR = 82% ‚Üí "Excellent! Above benchmark (75%)"
- SLA = 77% ‚Üí "Critical issue! Below target (85%)"
- **Makes CORRECT decisions**

### Trust & Credibility:
- User pays 199k VND/month for accurate data
- Discovers values are swapped ‚ÜíZERO trust in entire system
- **Churn risk**: 100% - User will never use product again
- **Reputation damage**: Negative reviews, warns other SMEs

### Scale Impact:
As user said: **"Chi ti·∫øt nh·ªè ch∆∞a chu·∫©n ‚Üí scale l√™n = s·ª± c·ªë n·∫∑ng n·ªÅ"**

- 1 user affected = bug report
- 10 users affected = support overload  
- 100 users affected = business crisis
- **MUST fix before Domain #7 testing**

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIX ACTIONS

### Action 1: Verify Deployment Status (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Check GitHub commits
git log --oneline -5

# Verify Streamlit Cloud is running latest code
# Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/dashboard
# Check deployment logs for commit 2dda987
```

### Action 2: Clear All Caches (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# In Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
# 1. Click "Reboot app"
# 2. Or click "Clear cache" then "Reboot"

# User side:
# 1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
# 2. Clear browser cache for the app URL
```

### Action 3: Add Debug Logging (if issue persists)
```python
# In premium_lean_pipeline.py after KPI calculations:
import logging
logging.info(f"FCR calculated: {fcr_rate:.2f}%")
logging.info(f"SLA calculated: {sla_rate:.2f}%")
logging.info(f"KPIs dict: {list(kpis.items())}")
```

### Action 4: Add Production Validation (CRITICAL)
```python
# In streamlit_app.py, after KPI display:
if 'First Contact Resolution (%)' in kpis and 'SLA Met (%)' in kpis:
    fcr_val = kpis['First Contact Resolution (%)']['value']
    sla_val = kpis['SLA Met (%)']['value']
    
    # Sanity check: FCR and SLA shouldn't be exactly swapped
    if abs(fcr_val - 77.0) < 0.1 and abs(sla_val - 82.0) < 0.1:
        st.error("‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: FCR/SLA values appear swapped! Please refresh.")
        st.info(f"FCR shows {fcr_val}% (expected ~82%) | SLA shows {sla_val}% (expected ~77%)")
```

### Action 5: Re-order KPI Display (WORKAROUND)
If swap persists, explicitly control display order in `streamlit_app.py`:

```python
# Instead of iterating dict.items(), use explicit order:
kpi_display_order = [
    'Avg First Response Time (min)',
    'CSAT Score',
    'Avg Resolution Time (hrs)',
    'SLA Met (%)',
    'First Contact Resolution (%)',
    'Escalation Rate (%)',
    'Reopen Rate (%)',
    'Total Ticket Value (VND)'
]

for kpi_name in kpi_display_order:
    if kpi_name in kpis:
        # Display KPI
        ...
```

---

## üß™ VALIDATION PLAN

### Test 1: Verify Fix on Production
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Streamlit Cloud deployment
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Re-upload `customer_service_tickets_30days.csv`
4. Check KPI values:
   - FCR should show **82.0%** (not 77.0%)
   - SLA should show **77.0%** (not 82.0%)
5. If STILL swapped ‚Üí proceed to Action 3-5

### Test 2: Cross-Verify with Expert Insights
- Check if AI insights mention FCR or SLA
- See if insights correctly identify SLA as problem area (77% < 85% target)
- See if insights correctly identify FCR as strength (82% > 75% benchmark)

### Test 3: Validate All Other KPIs
-Avg First Response Time: 18.8 min ‚úÖ
- CSAT Score: 4.22 (production shows 4.4 - investigate separately)
- Avg Resolution Time: 4.35 hrs (production shows 4.2 - minor rounding)
- Escalation Rate: 21.0% ‚úÖ
- Reopen Rate: 18.0% ‚úÖ
- Total Ticket Value: 397,845,000 VND ‚úÖ

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Fix is COMPLETE when:

‚úÖ Production dashboard shows:
  - First Contact Resolution (%): 82.0 (NOT 77.0)
  - SLA Met (%): 77.0 (NOT 82.0)

‚úÖ Expert Insights correctly identify:
  - SLA as problem area (below 85% target)
  - FCR as strength (above 75% benchmark)

‚úÖ User confirms 5-star experience:
  - Data accuracy: 100%
  - Trust in system: Restored
  - Ready to proceed to Domain #7

---

## üìù NOTES

- This bug is **CRITICAL** because it directly affects data accuracy
- Follows "zero tolerance" philosophy for production quality
- Must be fixed **BEFORE** proceeding to next domain
- Demonstrates importance of production validation, not just unit tests

---

**Next Step**: User must re-test production and report FCR/SLA values to confirm fix status.
