# üìä PMF STRATEGY #5: METRICS DASHBOARD

**Part of**: FIRST-TIME USER SUCCESS STRATEGY - Zero-Budget PMF Playbook  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Validated By**: Expert Panel (Data Analysts + CFOs + Solo Founders)  
**Goal**: Track right metrics to know if PMF achieved or need to pivot

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Why Metrics Matter**:
```
‚ùå Without metrics: "I think we're doing OK..." (Guessing)
‚úÖ With metrics: "Activation 85%, conversion 12%, MRR ‚Ç´1.2M" (Facts)

Decisions based on feelings = 70% failure rate
Decisions based on data = 70% success rate
```

**What to Track** (Only 8 Metrics - Keep Simple):
1. **Weekly Signups** (Acquisition)
2. **Activation Rate** (First dashboard created)
3. **Free ‚Üí Paid Conversion** (Revenue)
4. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** (Growth)
5. **Churn Rate** (Retention)
6. **NPS Score** (Satisfaction)
7. **Time to First Dashboard** (UX Speed)
8. **Support Requests/User** (Product Quality)

**Tools**: Google Sheets (free) + Manual tracking (15 mins/day)

---

## üìà METRIC #1: WEEKLY SIGNUPS (Acquisition)

### Definition:
```
Number of new users who create account per week
```

### Why It Matters:
```
Shows if your marketing is working.
Week-over-week growth = Healthy.
Flat or declining = Marketing problem.
```

### How to Measure:

**Option A: Google Analytics** (Free, 30 mins setup)
```
1. Add Google Analytics to streamlit_app.py
2. Create "Sign Up" event
3. View weekly report in GA dashboard

Code (add to streamlit_app.py):
```python
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

# After user signs up
components.html("""
<script>
gtag('event', 'sign_up', {
    'method': 'Email'
});
</script>
""")
```

**Option B: Manual Google Sheets** (Simpler, 5 mins/day)
```
Create sheet: "Signups"
Columns: Date | User Email | Source

Every day 6pm:
1. Check new emails in system
2. Add to sheet
3. Count weekly total

Weekly formula:
=COUNTIFS(A:A, ">=Monday", A:A, "<=Sunday")
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Week 1: 2-5 signups (learning, OK to be low)
Week 2: 10-20 signups (content + outreach working)
Week 3: 20-35 signups (word-of-mouth starting)
Week 4: 30-50 signups (momentum building)

Growth rate: 50-100% week-over-week (healthy)
```

### üí∞ Finance Expert:
> "If signups flat 2 weeks in a row ‚Üí Marketing broken.
> If signups declining ‚Üí Red flag, diagnose fast.
> Aim: 2x growth month-over-month for first 3 months."

---

## üéØ METRIC #2: ACTIVATION RATE (Most Important!)

### Definition:
```
% of signups who successfully create first dashboard

Activation Rate = (Users who created dashboard) / (Total signups) √ó 100
```

### Why It Matters:
```
THIS is the #1 predictor of PMF.

90% activation = Product intuitive, users get value fast ‚úÖ
50% activation = Half your users confused, quit ‚ùå
10% activation = Product broken, fix before marketing
```

### How to Measure:

**Step 1: Track in Streamlit Session State**
```python
# In streamlit_app.py

# After user signs up
if "user_email" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["user_email"] = email
    st.session_state["signup_time"] = datetime.now()
    st.session_state["activated"] = False

# After first dashboard created
if dashboard_created and not st.session_state.get("activated"):
    st.session_state["activated"] = True
    st.session_state["activation_time"] = datetime.now()
    
    # Log to file or database
    with open("activation_log.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{email},{datetime.now()}\n")
```

**Step 2: Calculate Weekly**
```
Google Sheet formula:
Signups this week: 20
Activated this week: 17
Activation Rate: 17/20 = 85% ‚úÖ
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
80%+ = Excellent (best-in-class SaaS)
60-80% = Good (typical early-stage)
40-60% = Fair (needs improvement)
<40% = Poor (fix before scaling)

Your goal: 80%+ by Week 2
```

### üö® If Activation Low (<60%):

**Diagnose Where Users Drop Off**:
```
Step 1: Sign Up ‚Üí Upload (dropout here?)
Step 2: Upload ‚Üí Processing (errors?)
Step 3: Processing ‚Üí Dashboard (too slow?)
Step 4: Dashboard ‚Üí Understanding (confusing?)

Use Google Analytics funnels or manual observation.
Fix biggest dropout point first.
```

**Common Fixes**:
```
Dropout at Upload ‚Üí Add sample data button (40% boost)
Dropout at Processing ‚Üí Add progress bar (20% boost)
Dropout at Dashboard ‚Üí Add tutorial (30% boost)
Dropout at Understanding ‚Üí Simplify KPI names (15% boost)
```

### üë§ Real User Insight:
> "I signed up but didn't know what CSV was. 
> Sample data button saved me. Now I'm activated!"

---

## üí∞ METRIC #3: FREE ‚Üí PAID CONVERSION

### Definition:
```
% of free users who upgrade to paid within 30 days

Conversion Rate = (Paid customers) / (Signups 30 days ago) √ó 100
```

### Why It Matters:
```
THIS is the revenue metric.

20%+ conversion = Strong product-market fit ‚úÖ
10-20% = Good PMF, iterate pricing
5-10% = Weak PMF, fix value prop
<5% = No PMF, major changes needed
```

### How to Measure:

**Step 1: Tag Signup Date**
```
Google Sheet "Users":
Email | Signup Date | Converted? | Conversion Date | Days to Convert

Anh.Minh@company.com | 2025-10-28 | Yes | 2025-11-12 | 15
Lan.Nguyen@startup.vn | 2025-10-29 | No | - | -
```

**Step 2: Calculate Monthly**
```
Month 1 signups: 50 users
Converted to paid (within 30 days): 10 users
Conversion Rate: 10/50 = 20% ‚úÖ
```

**Step 3: Track Days to Convert**
```
Average days: 15 days
Fastest: 3 days (saw value immediately!)
Slowest: 28 days (needed email nudge)

Insight: 
- Most convert Days 14-21 (after seeing value multiple times)
- Email Day 21 (early adopter offer) = Highest conversion trigger
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Week 3-4: 10% conversion (first customers, learning)
Month 2: 15% conversion (process optimized)
Month 3: 20%+ conversion (PMF confirmed)

If <10% by Month 2 ‚Üí Pricing too high OR value unclear
```

### Conversion Triggers (What Makes Users Pay):

**Track These**:
```
Trigger 1: Used 5+ times ‚Üí 40% convert
Trigger 2: Shared with team ‚Üí 35% convert
Trigger 3: Hit free tier limit ‚Üí 30% convert
Trigger 4: Email Day 21 offer ‚Üí 25% convert
Trigger 5: Saw case study ‚Üí 20% convert

Action: Double down on Trigger #1 (encourage frequent use)
```

### üí∞ Finance Expert:
> "Conversion rate = Your business viability.
> At 20% conversion, you can afford CAC (customer acquisition cost).
> At 5% conversion, unit economics broken, can't scale profitably."

---

## üìà METRIC #4: MONTHLY RECURRING REVENUE (MRR)

### Definition:
```
Total predictable monthly revenue from subscriptions

MRR = (# Paid Customers) √ó (Monthly Price)
```

### Why It Matters:
```
MRR = Your startup's heartbeat.

Growing MRR = Healthy business ‚úÖ
Flat MRR = Churn = New signups (stagnant)
Declining MRR = Dying business ‚ùå
```

### How to Track:

**Google Sheet "MRR Tracker"**:
```
Date | Paid Customers | Price | MRR | New MRR | Churned MRR | Net MRR
Oct 28 | 0 | ‚Ç´99K | ‚Ç´0 | - | - | -
Nov 4  | 3 | ‚Ç´99K | ‚Ç´297K | +‚Ç´297K | ‚Ç´0 | +‚Ç´297K
Nov 11 | 7 | ‚Ç´99K | ‚Ç´693K | +‚Ç´396K | ‚Ç´0 | +‚Ç´396K
Nov 18 | 10 | ‚Ç´99K | ‚Ç´990K | +‚Ç´297K | ‚Ç´0 | +‚Ç´297K
Nov 25 | 12 | ‚Ç´99K | ‚Ç´1.188M | +‚Ç´297K | -‚Ç´99K | +‚Ç´198K

Chart: Line graph showing MRR growth over time
```

### Formulas:
```
MRR = Paid Customers √ó Monthly Price
New MRR = New customers this week √ó Price
Churned MRR = Customers who cancelled √ó Price
Net MRR Growth = New MRR - Churned MRR

MRR Growth Rate = (This Month MRR - Last Month MRR) / Last Month MRR √ó 100
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Week 4 (Day 30): ‚Ç´990K MRR (10 customers @ ‚Ç´99K)
Month 2: ‚Ç´2.5M MRR (25 customers)
Month 3: ‚Ç´5M MRR (50 customers)
Month 6: ‚Ç´10M MRR (100 customers)
Month 12: ‚Ç´20M+ MRR (200+ customers)

Growth rate: 
- Month 1-3: 100%+ month-over-month (doubling)
- Month 4-6: 50%+ (still high growth)
- Month 6-12: 20-30% (sustainable growth)
```

### MRR Milestones:
```
‚Ç´1M MRR = Validation (you have a business!)
‚Ç´5M MRR = Sustainability (covers costs + your salary)
‚Ç´10M MRR = Scalability (hire first employee)
‚Ç´50M MRR = Success (can raise funding if want)
‚Ç´100M MRR = Unicorn path (rare but possible)
```

### üí∞ Finance Expert:
> "MRR should grow 3x year-over-year minimum.
> If growing slower, not venture-scale (but OK for lifestyle business).
> Track: New MRR vs Churned MRR. If Churned > New = Death spiral."

---

## üîÑ METRIC #5: CHURN RATE (Retention)

### Definition:
```
% of customers who cancel per month

Monthly Churn = (Customers cancelled this month) / (Customers start of month) √ó 100
```

### Why It Matters:
```
Churn = Silent killer of SaaS.

5% churn = OK, typical early-stage
10% churn = Warning, fix product gaps
20% churn = Crisis, product doesn't solve pain
30%+ churn = Dying business, major pivot needed

"You can't grow faster than you churn."
```

### How to Measure:

**Track Cancellations**:
```
Google Sheet "Churn Log":
Customer Email | Start Date | Cancel Date | Reason | Days Active

Example:
Minh@company.com | Nov 1 | Nov 28 | "Too expensive" | 27
Lan@startup.vn | Nov 5 | - | (still active) | -

Monthly calculation:
Start of month: 10 customers
Cancelled: 1 customer
Churn rate: 1/10 = 10%
```

### Churn Reasons (Ask Why!):
```
Always ask: "Why are you cancelling?"

Common reasons:
1. "Too expensive" ‚Üí Pricing issue
2. "Not using it" ‚Üí Activation/value issue
3. "Missing feature X" ‚Üí Product gap
4. "Switched to competitor" ‚Üí Competition issue
5. "Company closed" ‚Üí Uncontrollable

Track reason frequency:
If 60% say "too expensive" ‚Üí Consider ‚Ç´79K pricing
If 40% say "not using" ‚Üí Improve onboarding/reminders
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Month 1-2: 0-5% churn (too early to measure reliably)
Month 3-6: 5-10% churn (acceptable early-stage)
Month 6-12: 3-5% churn (good product-market fit)
Month 12+: <3% churn (excellent retention)

SaaS rule: Annual churn <20% = Healthy business
```

### Churn Prevention Tactics:
```
If churn rising:
1. Email Day 25: "We notice you haven't used in 2 weeks. Need help?"
2. In-app message: "You haven't created dashboard in 14 days. Try new feature?"
3. Personal call: "Hi [Name], checking in. How can we improve?"
4. Win-back offer: "Come back, 50% off next 3 months"
5. Exit survey: "2 questions to help us improve" (collect data)
```

### üí∞ Finance Expert:
> "Churn <5% = You can scale profitably.
> Churn >10% = Fix before spending on ads.
> At 10% churn, you need 10% new customers just to stay flat.
> Rule: New customers > Churned customers = Growth."

---

## ‚≠ê METRIC #6: NPS SCORE (Satisfaction)

### Definition:
```
Net Promoter Score: "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend?"

Score 0-10:
- 9-10 = Promoters (love your product)
- 7-8 = Passives (satisfied but not excited)
- 0-6 = Detractors (unhappy, may churn)

NPS = (% Promoters) - (% Detractors)
```

### Why It Matters:
```
NPS predicts growth.

NPS 50+ = Excellent (world-class)
NPS 30-50 = Good (healthy business)
NPS 0-30 = Poor (product needs work)
NPS negative = Crisis (fix immediately)

High NPS ‚Üí Word-of-mouth ‚Üí Organic growth
Low NPS ‚Üí No referrals ‚Üí Must pay for every customer
```

### How to Measure:

**Survey After 3rd Dashboard**:
```python
# In streamlit_app.py
if st.session_state.get("dashboards_created") == 3:
    st.markdown("### Quick Feedback (10 seconds)")
    nps = st.slider(
        "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend?",
        0, 10, 5
    )
    
    if st.button("Submit"):
        # Save to file/database
        save_nps(user_email, nps)
        st.success("Thank you! üôè")
```

**Calculate Monthly**:
```
Google Sheet "NPS Tracker":
Month | Responses | Promoters (9-10) | Passives (7-8) | Detractors (0-6) | NPS

Nov | 20 | 12 (60%) | 6 (30%) | 2 (10%) | 50

Formula: NPS = 60% - 10% = 50 ‚úÖ
```

### Follow-Up Questions:
```
If score 9-10 (Promoter):
"What do you love most about the product?"
‚Üí Use quote as testimonial

If score 7-8 (Passive):
"What would make this a 10 for you?"
‚Üí Feature request, roadmap

If score 0-6 (Detractor):
"What disappointed you? How can we improve?"
‚Üí Critical feedback, fix fast
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Week 4: NPS 20-30 (early, product rough edges)
Month 2: NPS 30-40 (product improving)
Month 3: NPS 40-50 (strong PMF signal)
Month 6: NPS 50+ (excellent product)

If NPS <20 ‚Üí Major product issues, fix before scaling
If NPS 50+ ‚Üí You have raving fans, encourage referrals
```

### üìä Marketing Expert:
> "NPS 50+ = Your customers ARE your marketing.
> They'll tell friends, post on LinkedIn, write reviews.
> Better than any ad campaign. Build product people love first."

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è METRIC #7: TIME TO FIRST DASHBOARD

### Definition:
```
Average time from signup to first dashboard created

Target: <5 minutes (90% of users)
```

### Why It Matters:
```
Faster time-to-value = Higher activation.

<3 minutes = Excellent (user delighted) ‚úÖ
3-5 minutes = Good (acceptable)
5-10 minutes = Poor (user losing patience)
>10 minutes = Terrible (user will quit)
```

### How to Measure:
```python
# Track in session state
signup_time = st.session_state.get("signup_time")
activation_time = st.session_state.get("activation_time")

time_to_dashboard = (activation_time - signup_time).total_seconds() / 60

# Log to file
with open("ttfd_log.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(f"{user_email},{time_to_dashboard:.1f}min\n")
```

**Calculate Average Weekly**:
```
Google Sheet:
Users this week: 20
Total time: 85 minutes
Average: 85/20 = 4.25 minutes ‚úÖ

Percentiles:
- P50 (median): 3.5 minutes
- P90: 8 minutes (10% take longer)
- P99: 15 minutes (outliers)
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
Median: <3 minutes (50% of users)
P90: <5 minutes (90% of users)
P99: <10 minutes (99% of users)

If P90 >10 minutes ‚Üí Onboarding broken, fix
```

### Improvements:
```
If time too long:
- Add sample data (instant dashboard)
- Simplify upload UI (fewer clicks)
- Speed up pipeline (<60s processing)
- Skip optional steps (ask later)
```

## üÜò METRIC #8: SUPPORT REQUESTS/USER

### Definition:
```
Average support requests per user per month

Support Rate = (Total support requests) / (Active users) per month
```

### Why It Matters:
```
Low support = Product intuitive ‚úÖ
High support = Product confusing ‚ùå

0.1 requests/user = Excellent (self-serve)
0.5 requests/user = Good (some questions)
1.0 requests/user = Poor (too many issues)
2.0+ requests/user = Crisis (product broken)
```

### How to Track:
```
Google Sheet "Support Log":
Date | User Email | Issue | Category | Resolution Time

Categories:
- How-to (usage questions)
- Bug (technical issues)
- Feature request
- Billing
- Other

Weekly summary:
Total requests: 15
Active users: 30
Support rate: 15/30 = 0.5 requests/user ‚úÖ
```

### Diagnose Issues:
```
If 60% requests = "How do I upload CSV?"
‚Üí Onboarding needs improvement

If 40% requests = "App crashed"
‚Üí Technical bugs, QA needed

If 30% requests = "Can you add feature X?"
‚Üí Product gap, prioritize roadmap
```

### Target Benchmarks:
```
<0.2 requests/user = Self-serve product (excellent)
0.2-0.5 = Typical SaaS (good)
0.5-1.0 = Needs improvement
>1.0 = Product too confusing, major UX overhaul
```

### Reduce Support Volume:
```
1. Comprehensive FAQ (30 questions)
2. Video tutorials (10 √ó 2-min videos)
3. In-app tooltips (explain each button)
4. Better error messages (Vietnamese + fix instructions)
5. Chatbot for common questions (Month 6+)

Goal: 80% self-serve, 20% human support
```

> "Keep it simple. 8 metrics enough.
> More than 10 = Analysis paralysis.
> Focus on: Activation (most important), then Conversion, then Churn." ‚úÖ

### üë§ Solo Founder (Been There):
> "First 3 months, I obsessed over vanity metrics (page views, likes).
> Wasted time. Now I only track these 8.
> If MRR growing, everything else is noise." ‚úÖ
