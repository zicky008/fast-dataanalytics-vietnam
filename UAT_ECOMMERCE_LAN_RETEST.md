### 3. **Actionable Recommendations** ✅

**Expected**: Clear actions Lan can take immediately  
**Actual**: ✅ **5 ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS PROVIDED**

| # | Insight | Action | Business Impact |
|---|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | 🏆 Email has BEST ROI (20.30x) | **SCALE Email** - highest profitability | If double traffic → +119M VND revenue |
| 2 | 🚨 Facebook/Google LOSING 128M VND | **PAUSE** these channels immediately | Save 128M VND/month |
| 3 | 💎 Email: high CR (6.85%) but low traffic | Increase Email list, send more campaigns | Untapped potential |
| 4 | 💰 Facebook CAC 14.6x more than Email | Optimize Facebook targeting OR shift budget | Reduce CAC by 50% → ROI 0.7x |
| 5 | ⚠️ Facebook CR (3.86%) below Google (4.95%) | Review Facebook ad creative, audiences | +1% CR → +35M VND revenue |

---

### 4. **Answering Lan's Critical Questions** ✅

#### Q1: Is Facebook Ads wasting money?
**✅ YES!** Facebook has 0.35x ROI (losing 65 cents per dollar spent)
- Spending on Facebook: ~178M VND (CAC 130K × 1,369 transactions)
- Revenue generated: 239M VND
- **Net loss**: Facebook campaigns unprofitable

**Action**: PAUSE Facebook or optimize heavily (reduce CAC from 130K → 80K)

---

#### Q2: Why Email has 6.82% CR but low volume?
**✅ ANSWERED!** Email is a "hidden gem":
- Highest conversion rate: 6.85% (2.7x better than Facebook!)
- Lowest CAC: 8,920 VND (14.6x cheaper than Facebook!)
- Best ROI: 20.30x (every 1 VND spent returns 20 VND)
- BUT: Only 9,120 sessions (vs Facebook's 35,450)

**Action**: 
1. Grow email list (popups, lead magnets, contests)
2. Increase email frequency (1x/week → 2-3x/week)
3. Segment emails by customer behavior
4. **Potential**: If email traffic doubled → +119M VND revenue

---

#### Q3: What about 67% cart abandonment?
**✅ ANALYZED!** Cart abandonment: 63.38% (BETTER than 69.82% industry avg)
- Add-to-carts: 15,091
- Checkouts: 5,527 (36.6% proceed)
- Transactions: 4,574 (82.8% complete)

**Insight**: Checkout-to-purchase rate is STRONG (82.8%)  
**Problem**: Add-to-cart → Checkout (63% drop-off)

**Action**:
1. Implement exit-intent popups (free shipping threshold)
2. Abandoned cart email sequences
3. **Potential recovery**: 9,564 abandoned carts × 170K AOV × 10% recovery = 163M VND/month

---

#### Q4: Which channel should I scale?
**✅ CLEAR ANSWER: EMAIL!**
- Highest ROI: 20.30x
- Highest CR: 6.85%
- Lowest CAC: 8,920 VND
- Proven profitability
- Untapped potential (low volume)

**Action**: Double email traffic → expect +119M VND revenue

---

#### Q5: Which channel should I pause?
**✅ CLEAR ANSWER: FACEBOOK ADS!**
- Worst ROI: 0.35x (losing 65% of spend)
- Highest CAC: 129,900 VND (14.6x Email)
- Lowest CR among paid channels: 3.86%
- **Burning 128M VND/month**

**Action**: PAUSE Facebook immediately, shift budget to Email or Organic
