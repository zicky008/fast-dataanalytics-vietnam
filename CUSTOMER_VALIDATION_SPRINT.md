# üéØ CUSTOMER VALIDATION SPRINT - Week 1 Playbook

**Purpose**: Validate customer demand BEFORE spending months building/scaling

**Timeline**: 7 days

**Cost**: ‚Ç´0 (just your time)

**Goal**: Get 5-10 paying customer commitments

**Decision**: GO / ADJUST / STOP based on results

---

## üö® WHY THIS MATTERS

### The Startup Graveyard Statistics

```

70% of startups fail because: "Built something nobody wanted"

- Spent 6-12 months building

- Spent ‚Ç´50M-200M cash

- Had 0 paying customers

- Realized: Wrong problem, wrong solution, wrong market

YOUR ADVANTAGE:

Validate in 1 week (‚Ç´0 cost) ‚Üí Avoid 6 months wasted

```

### Real Quote from Growth VP:

> "I've failed 2 startups ($100K lost) because I skipped validation. I was SO SURE the market needed my product. I was wrong. Don't be me. Talk to customers FIRST."

### Evening: Answer Questions They Ask You

**Common Questions from Prospects**:

**Q: "What is this tool exactly?"**

```

A: "It's a tool that automatically creates professional dashboards

from your Excel/CSV files in 60 seconds.

No learning curve, no Data Analyst needed.

Think: Upload data ‚Üí Dashboard ready ‚Üí Export to PDF for stakeholders.

Still in research phase, that's why I'm asking for feedback first."

```

**Q: "When will it be ready?"**

```

A: "Aiming for 2-3 tu·∫ßn n·ªØa for early access (beta).

That's why I want to get feedback from 10-15 CEOs first

to make sure it solves the right problems."

```

**Q: "Is it free?"**

```

A: "First 3 months free for early customers (like b·∫°n).

After that: ‚Ç´99K/month if you find it valuable,

otherwise cancel anytime - no commitment."

```

**Q: "What data sources?"**

```

A: "Currently: CSV, Excel files (most common).

Planning to add: Google Sheets, Shopee data, Facebook Ads, etc.

What data source would be most useful for you?"

---

## üìã DAY 6 (SATURDAY): ANALYZE PATTERNS

### Goal: Find Patterns & Key Insights (3 hours)

### Analysis Framework

#### 1. Pain Point Analysis

**Aggregate Responses from Q1-Q2**:

Create table:

| Pain Point | # Mentions | Severity (avg) | Quote |

|------------|------------|----------------|-------|

| "Excel takes 3+ hours/week" | 12 | 8.5/10 | "I dread Monday mornings because of reports" |

| "Don't have Data Analyst" | 8 | 7/10 | "We can't afford ‚Ç´20M/month for analyst" |

| "Tableau too complex to learn" | 5 | 6/10 | "Team doesn't use Tableau, waste of money" |

| "Stakeholders always ask for ad-hoc reports" | 7 | 7.5/10 | "I become data monkey instead of CMO" |

**Top 3 Pains** (Focus here):

1\. Manual Excel work (time-consuming) - 12/20 people

2\. No internal data expertise - 8/20 people

3\. Ad-hoc report requests - 7/20 people

---

#### 2. Willingness to Pay Analysis

**Aggregate Responses from Q3**:

| Price Point | # YES | # MAYBE | # NO | Conversion % |

|-------------|-------|---------|------|--------------|

| ‚Ç´99K/month | 14 | 4 | 2 | 70% (strong!) |

| ‚Ç´49K/month | 18 | 2 | 0 | 90% (even better) |

**Insights**:

- ‚úÖ ‚Ç´99K is acceptable for 70% (higher than expected!)

- ‚úÖ ‚Ç´49K for early adopters could get 90% conversion

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 people said "too expensive" ‚Üí Dig deeper: Budget constraints or value not clear?

---

#### 3. Commitment Analysis (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Aggregate Responses from Q4**:

| Commitment Level | Count | % | Action |

|------------------|-------|---|--------|

| **STRONG** ("YES! Email me when ready") | 8 | 40% | ‚úÖ These are your first customers |

| **MEDIUM** ("Maybe, show me demo") | 6 | 30% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Follow up with mockups |

| **WEAK** ("Not sure, think about it") | 4 | 20% | Low priority |

| **NO** ("Not interested") | 2 | 10% | Archive |

**SUCCESS METRIC**: 8 strong commitments = ‚úÖ **VALIDATION PASSED**

---

#### 4. Feature Priority Analysis

**From deep dive conversations, what features matter most?**

| Feature | # Requests | Priority | Complexity | MVP? |

|---------|------------|----------|------------|------|

| Auto-dashboard from CSV | 20 | HIGH | Medium | ‚úÖ YES |

| Export to PDF | 15 | HIGH | Low | ‚úÖ YES |

| Benchmark comparisons | 10 | MEDIUM | Medium | ‚è≥ Phase 2 |

| Team collaboration | 7 | MEDIUM | High | ‚è≥ Phase 3 |

| API integrations (Shopee, FB Ads) | 12 | HIGH | High | ‚è≥ Phase 2 |

**MVP Focus** (Build ONLY these first):

1\. Upload CSV ‚Üí Auto-dashboard (core value)

2\. Export to PDF (stakeholder sharing)

3\. E-commerce domain expertise (niche focus)

**Everything else**: Phase 2 (after first 20 customers)

---

#### 5. Competitive Intelligence

**What tools are they using today?**

| Tool | # Users | Pain with Tool | Opportunity |

|------|---------|----------------|-------------|

| Excel | 14 | "Too manual, time-consuming" | ‚úÖ Direct replacement |

| Google Sheets | 8 | "Still manual, limited charts" | ‚úÖ Direct replacement |

| Tableau | 3 | "Too complex, expensive ($70/user)" | ‚úÖ Simpler + cheaper |

| Power BI | 2 | "Learning curve too steep" | ‚úÖ Zero learning curve |

| Data Analyst (hired) | 1 | "‚Ç´20M/month, hard to find" | ‚úÖ 500x cheaper |

| Nothing (raw data only) | 2 | "No insights at all" | ‚úÖ Huge value jump |

**Competitive Angle**: "Excel simplicity + Tableau power, 60 seconds, ‚Ç´99K/month"

### SCENARIO A: 5-10+ Strong Commitments ‚úÖ **GO!**

**What This Means**:

- Clear market demand validated

- People willing to pay ‚Ç´99K/month

- 8-10 customers ready to try (beta group)

- Pain is urgent (high priority problem)

**Next Steps**:

```

Week 2-3: Build MVP

- Focus ONLY on must-have features

- Upload CSV ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Export PDF

- E-commerce domain first

Week 4: Invite first 8 customers to beta

- Free for 3 months

- Weekly feedback sessions

- Iterate based on usage

Month 2-3: Launch publicly

- Pricing: ‚Ç´49K for first 100 (early adopter)

- Then ‚Ç´99K regular pricing

- Target: 20-30 paying customers by Month 3

```

**Execute Revised Business Model Canvas** ‚úÖ

---

### SCENARIO B: 3-4 Commitments ‚ö†Ô∏è **ADJUST**

**What This Means**:

- Some demand, but not overwhelming

- Maybe: Wrong target market? Wrong pain? Wrong price?

- Need to adjust before building

**Diagnosis Questions**:

```

1\. Was pain real but solution not compelling?

‚Üí Adjust value prop (maybe demo/mockup would help)

2\. Was price too high?

‚Üí Test ‚Ç´49K/month with 10 more people

3\. Was target market too broad?

‚Üí Focus on specific sub-niche (e.g., Fashion E-commerce only)

4\. Was trust an issue?

‚Üí Get 1-2 customers to co-create (build WITH them)

```

**Next Steps**:

```

Week 2: ADJUST + RE-TEST

- Create visual mockups (Figma)

- Test ‚Ç´49K pricing with 20 new people

- Narrow niche (Fashion E-commerce S√†i G√≤n only)

- Offer to co-create with 2 customers

Week 3: Validation Sprint #2

- If now 5+ commitments ‚Üí GO

- If still < 5 ‚Üí Seriously consider STOP

```

---

### SCENARIO C: 0-2 Commitments üõë **STOP (or Pivot)**

**What This Means**:

- Pain not urgent enough

- Solution not compelling

- Price too high for value

- Wrong market entirely

**Diagnosis**:

```

Review responses:

- What did people say when they said NO?

- Was it: "Don't need this" or "Not urgent" or "Too expensive"?

Common reasons for 0-2 commitments:

1\. Pain not big enough (1-2 hrs/week ‚Üí not worth paying)

2\. Trust issue (new tool, unknown founder)

3\. Market timing (SMEs cutting costs, not buying new tools)

4\. Solution not differentiated (Excel is "good enough")

```

**Hard Truth from Expert Panel**:

> "If you can't get 5 people to commit to FREE BETA in 1 week,

you won't get 50 to pay ‚Ç´99K/month in 12 months.

Save yourself 6 months + ‚Ç´20M. Stop or pivot."

**Options**:

```

Option 1: STOP

- Gracefully shut down

- Thank everyone for feedback

- Save 6 months + ‚Ç´20M+

- Try different idea

Option 2: PIVOT

- Different pain point (e.g., marketing reports, not business dashboards)

- Different market (e.g., agencies, not brands)

- Different solution (e.g., consulting, not software)

Option 3: Co-Founder

- Find someone with complementary skills (sales, domain expertise)

- Try again with stronger team

```

## üí° KEY LESSONS (From Panel Experts)

### From Growth VP:

> "This 1-week sprint is more valuable than 3 months of product development. You'll learn:

> 1. Is pain real? (YES/NO)

> 2. Will they pay? (YES/NO)

> 3. What features matter? (Priority list)

> 4. Who are first customers? (Email list)

>

> Cost: ‚Ç´0 + 20 hours

> Alternative: 3 months building + ‚Ç´20M+ ‚Üí Find out nobody wants it

>

> ALWAYS validate first."

---

### From CFO:

> "8 strong commitments = $50K+ value:

> - 8 customers √ó ‚Ç´99K/month √ó 12 months = ‚Ç´9.5M ARR

> - Lifetime value (3 years avg) = ‚Ç´28.5M per cohort

> - You found this in 1 week with ‚Ç´0 cost

>

> That's the best ROI you'll ever get in business."

---

### From Vietnam Market Expert:

> "Vietnamese culture: People won't tell you directly 'No, I don't like your idea.'

> They'll say 'Interesting, let me think' (polite rejection).

>

> ONLY count STRONG commitments:

> ‚úÖ 'Email me when ready'

> ‚úÖ 'I'll be first to try'

> ‚úÖ 'Here's my email, add me to list'

>

> Ignore:

> ‚ùå 'Sounds interesting' (polite)

> ‚ùå 'Maybe' (no commitment)

> ‚ùå 'Let me think' (soft no)

>

> Get HARD commitments only."
