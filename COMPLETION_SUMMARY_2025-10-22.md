## ⏳ REMAINING OPTIONAL TASKS

### Bug #2: OEE Chart Y-Axis (Medium Priority)
**Status**: Pending investigation  
**User Report**: Y-axis shows "units" instead of "%"  
**Action Required**: Examine chart in detail from screenshot  
**Impact**: Visual clarity (not data accuracy)  

### Bug #4: Generic Benchmarks (Low Priority)
**Status**: Pending  
**Issue**: Benchmarks use ±5% instead of domain-specific values  
**Action Required**: Update to industry standards  
**Impact**: Cosmetic (doesn't affect core functionality)
