- [ ] Which KPIs did user focus on? (from Clarity heatmap)
- [ ] User confusion points (from recording)
- [ ] Feature requests (write down)

---

### Test 2: Retail Domain (Day 2)
**User Profile**: Physical store owner (fashion, electronics, grocery)

**Same protocol as Test 1**, but focus on:
- Inventory questions (slow-moving products)

---

### Test 3: Services Domain (Day 3)
**User Profile**: Spa, salon, clinic, gym owner

- Customer retention questions

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS (PHASE 1)

### Baseline Metrics (Current - Unknown)
```yaml
To Measure:
- Actual bounce rate (vs predicted 40%)
- Actual time-to-insight (vs predicted 45s)
- Actual "Xem th√™m" click rate (predict 50%+)
- Actual mobile usage % (predict 60%+)
- Actual domain demand (which domain has most interest?)
```

### Target Metrics (End of Phase 1 - 3 Days)
```yaml
Quantitative:
- [ ] 3 users tested (1 per domain)
- [ ] Clarity: 3+ full sessions recorded
- [ ] Average session duration: >2 minutes
- [ ] "Xem th√™m" click rate: >40%
- [ ] Mobile usage: >50%

Qualitative:
- [ ] Identify top domain (most pain points + willingness to pay)
- [ ] Document top 3 feature requests per domain
- [ ] Identify top 3 UX friction points
- [ ] Get 3 testimonials (even if "needs improvement")
```

---

## üéØ PHASE 1 DECISION POINT (Day 4)

After 3 days of testing, we decide:

### Scenario A: E-commerce has HIGHEST demand
```yaml
Signals:
- E-commerce user most excited
- Most feature requests from e-commerce
- E-commerce user asks "when can I use daily?"

Next Action: DEEP DIVE E-COMMERCE
- Create cart abandonment alert system
- Channel comparison detailed view
- Integration with Shopee API (future)
- Vietnamese e-commerce benchmarks (refined)
```

### Scenario B: Retail has HIGHEST demand
```yaml
Signals:
- Retail user has acute inventory pain
- Asks about staff performance tracking
- Willing to pay for solution

Next Action: DEEP DIVE RETAIL
- Inventory slow-moving alerts
- Staff performance dashboard
- Peak hours heatmap
- POS integration roadmap
```

### Scenario C: Services has HIGHEST demand
```yaml
Signals:
- Services user frustrated with no-shows
- Asks about package upsell tracking
- Needs customer retention features

Next Action: DEEP DIVE SERVICES
- No-show rate tracking + alerts
- Package conversion funnel
- Customer lifetime value calculator
- Booking system integration
```

### Scenario D: ALL 3 have demand (unlikely but possible)
```yaml
Next Action: PRIORITIZE by Revenue Potential
- Which domain willing to pay most?
- Which domain easiest to serve?
- Which domain fastest time-to-revenue?
```

   - Heatmap analysis
   - Bounce rate, time-to-insight metrics
   
2. **Domain Priority Decision**
   - Which domain to deep dive FIRST
   - Why? (data-backed reasoning)
   - Top 3 feature requests for that domain
   
3. **Phase 2 Roadmap**
   - A-Z product details for chosen domain
   - Domain-specific features to build
   - Timeline: Week 2 implementation

---

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

### During Testing:
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Lead users ("Do you like this feature?")
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Let users explore naturally
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Ask "What are you thinking?" when they pause
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Record exact quotes (for testimonials)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Note when they look confused
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Ask "What would you do next?" at decision points

### After Testing:
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Build features users didn't ask for
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Assume all 3 domains need same features
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Focus on ONE domain first (highest ROI)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Validate with "Would you pay ‚Ç´99K/month for this?"
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Document everything (quotes, videos, metrics)

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**RIGHT NOW**: Local testing before deployment

```bash
cd /home/user/webapp
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Manual Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Upload `sample_data/ecommerce_shopify_daily.csv`

- [ ] No console errors?

**If ALL PASS ‚Üí Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**
**If FAIL ‚Üí Fix issues first, then deploy**
