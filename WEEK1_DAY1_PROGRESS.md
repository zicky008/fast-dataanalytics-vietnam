## 📊 MICROSOFT CLARITY - WHAT'S NEXT?

### Immediate Next Steps (After Deployment)
1. **Deploy app** to production (Streamlit Cloud or server)
2. **Wait 24 hours** for first data collection
3. **Access dashboard**: https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects/view/tybfgieemx
4. **Watch 10 sessions** to understand user behavior
5. **Note top 3 UX issues** discovered
6. **Plan fixes** for Day 3-4 (Progressive Disclosure)

### Week 1 Testing Milestones
```yaml
Day 1-2 (Today):
  - ✅ Clarity integrated
  - ⏳ Baseline metrics needed (after 24h)

Day 3-4:
  - Progressive Disclosure implementation
  - Compare bounce rate before/after
  - Target: 40% → 30%

Day 5-7:
  - At-a-Glance Dashboard
  - Monitor session recordings
  - Target: 30% → 20%

Day 8-10:
  - User testing with 5 SME owners
  - Compare Clarity data vs interviews
  - Target: UX 2.2 → 3.8 stars
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Clarity Data Collection Timing
```
After deployment:
  + 2-4 hours: First sessions appear
  + 24 hours: Reliable baseline metrics
  + 7 days: Enough data for trends
  + 30 days: Comprehensive insights
```

### What to Monitor Daily (Starting Day 2)
- Bounce rate (target: <20%)
- Session duration (target: 2-3 min)
- Rage clicks (target: <5%)
- Dead clicks (target: <3%)
- Mobile vs Desktop split
- Most viewed pages
- Most clicked elements

### Red Flags to Watch For
- 🚨 Bounce rate >50% → UX needs immediate attention
- 🚨 Rage clicks >10% → Frustration with specific element
- 🚨 Dead clicks >5% → UI confusion
- 🚨 Session duration <30s → Content not engaging

## 🎓 LEARNING & INSIGHTS

### What Went Well
1. **User provided Project ID quickly** → Fast integration
2. **Documentation-first approach** → Easy to maintain
3. **Performance logging** → Can measure Clarity impact (~50ms)
4. **Git workflow** → Clean commit history

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Visual testing not done yet** → Need real device testing
2. **No baseline metrics yet** → Need to deploy first
3. **User feedback pending** → Need 5 SME owner interviews

### Technical Decisions
```yaml
Why Clarity over Hotjar?
  - Clarity: Unlimited sessions (₫0 forever)
  - Hotjar: 35 sessions/day (limited)
  - Decision: Clarity is RECOMMENDED ⭐

Why inject tracking code early?
  - Collect baseline data before UX improvements
  - Compare before/after metrics
  - Validate Phase P0 impact (UX 2.2 → 3.8)

Why comprehensive documentation?
  - Founder is introvert → Needs written guide
  - Session continuity → AI can resume context
  - Onboarding future team members
```

- [ ] Continue with visual testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Run integration testing with sample data
- [ ] Verify Clarity tracking is working
- [ ] Update checkpoint to 100% when done
